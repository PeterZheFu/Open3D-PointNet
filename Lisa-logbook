#Research goal 

#5W AND 1H

#Why what where when who and how

Before research, was limited on linux and bearly using command line; but now, i learnt a lot.

Since this project requires CUDA, which mac doesn't have, i had to find a way to make it work on my computer.

For the past serval days, i has been working on the google cloud platform and trying to make it work. Google could platform 
was user friendly for a new beginner besides sometime it may give me error says that "quote exceeded in your area" and i have 
to request for extra/more quote again and again. 

Plan for this week:

trying to set things up before thursday( waiting for reply from google
and then what?
